# Welcome to My Project

This is a **Markdown** document created to demonstrate basic formatting and structure. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes writing and formatting text easy.

## Features of Markdown

1. **Simple Syntax**: No need for complex tags or styles.
2. **Readable Format**: Text is easy to read and write.
3. **Multi-platform Support**: Works across various platforms like GitHub, Reddit, and more.

### Common Formatting Options

- **Bold**: Use `**` or `__` for **bold text**.
- *Italic*: Use `*` or `_` for *italicized text*.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use `~~` for ~~strikethrough~~.

### Code Snippets

Inline code can be added with backticks: `console.log("Hello, Markdown!")`.

For blocks of code, use triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet("World");
